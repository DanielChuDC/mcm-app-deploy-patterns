# Some Typical App Deploy Patterns in IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management

## Concepts

[IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_1.3.0/kc_welcome_cloud_pak.html), a.k.a CP4MCM, introduces a lightweight app management model for the hybrid multicloud world.

The overall model can be illustrated as following:

![misc/mcm-app-model.png](misc/mcm-app-model.png)

## Get Started

> Note: these demos have been tested in the env where includes:
> 1. The CP4MCM v1.3 deployed on the Hub Cluster on IBM OpenShift Kubernetes Service, a.k.a ROKS;
> 2. One IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) cluster v1.15.x on IBM Cloud as the managed cluster

Before we try out these demo patterns, let's assume there is at least one managed cluster with following required tags:
- `cluster=managed-app-cluster`
- `environment=PROD`

Then we need to do two simple things:

1. To create two namespaces: `app-entitlement` and `app-project`;

2. To create necessary `ImagePolicy` for the images.

```sh
$ oc apply -f 0-preparation/1-namespace.yaml
$ oc apply -f 0-preparation/2-imagepolicy.yaml
```

> Note: the `ImagePolicy` here is really to allow almost every image, please review it while trying in production.

> OUTPUT:

```
namespace/app-entitlement created
namespace/app-project created

imagepolicy.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/app-image-policy created
```


## The Typical App Deploy Patterns

### Pattern #1: Namespace

#### Goal

The goal of this demo is to deploy a `ModResort` web-app to the managed cluster(s) by using explicit `Deployable`s in namespace.

#### Channel

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc apply -f 1-namespace/1-channel.yaml
```

> OUTPUT:

```
channel.app.ibm.com/app-modresort-channel created
deployable.app.ibm.com/app-modresort-deployment created
deployable.app.ibm.com/app-modresort-service created
```

#### Subscription

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc apply -f 1-namespace/2-subscription.yaml
```

> OUTPUT:

```
subscription.app.ibm.com/app-modresort created
application.app.k8s.io/app-modresort created
placementrule.app.ibm.com/app-modresort created
```

#### Outcome

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc get appsub,application,placementrule -n app-project
NAME                                     STATUS       AGE
subscription.app.ibm.com/app-modresort   Propagated   1m25s

NAME                                   AGE
application.app.k8s.io/app-modresort   1m25s

NAME                                      AGE
placementrule.app.ibm.com/app-modresort   1m25s
```

In Managed Cluster:

```sh
$ kubectl get pod -n default
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-modresort-deployment-6b9d78cc7c-l5cf2   1/1     Running   0          58s
```

> Note: the app is as expected to be placed under the managed cluster's `default` namespace.


### Pattern #2: Helm Repo

#### Goal

The goal of this demo is to deploy a Helm Chart from a Helm Repo to the managed cluster(s).

There are two examples:
1. The Channel points to "offical" [Kubernetes Charts repo](https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/) and Subscription looks for `phpmyadmin` Chart as target to deploy;
2. Another Channel points to a [custom Chart Repo](https://github.com/IBM/helm101) and Subscription looks for `guestbook` Chart as target to deploy.

> Note: 
> 1. The model of these two examples is identical;
> 2. The following process covers the first example but you can try another.

#### Channel

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc apply -f 2-helm-repo/1-channel.yaml
```

> OUTPUT:

```
channel.app.ibm.com/kubernetes-charts created
```

#### Subscription

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc apply -f 2-helm-repo/2-subscription.yaml
```

> OUTPUT:

```
subscription.app.ibm.com/app-phpmyadmin created
application.app.k8s.io/app-phpmyadmin created
placementrule.app.ibm.com/app-phpmyadmin-prod created
```

#### Outcome

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc get appsub,application,placementrule -l app=app-phpmyadmin -n app-project
NAME                                      STATUS       AGE
subscription.app.ibm.com/app-phpmyadmin   Propagated   6m52s

NAME                                    AGE
application.app.k8s.io/app-phpmyadmin   6m52s

NAME                                            AGE
placementrule.app.ibm.com/app-phpmyadmin-prod   6m52s
```

In Managed Cluster:

```sh
$ kubectl get pod -n default
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
phpmyadmin-79c9b6f7bd-6nhbf                 1/1     Running   0          5m14s
```

### Pattern #3: Object Bucket

#### Goal

The goal of this demo is to use a S3 Bucket as the Channel and deploy `Nginx` app to the Managed Cluster(s).

#### Prerequisites

1. S3-compliant server is accessible;
2. A bucket is created with deployable Kubernetes objects copied inside.

> Note: Please refer to [Annex -> Setup MinIO](#setup-minio) for a quick guide for MinIO.

#### Channel

In Hub Cluster:

> Note: change the 

```sh
$ oc create secret generic object-bucket-secret \
    --from-literal=AccessKeyID='<THE ACCESSKEY>' \          # CHANGE ME!!
    --from-literal=SecretAccessKey='<THE SECRETKEY>'        # CHANGE ME!!

$ MINIO_URL='http:\/\/your.minio.url\/bucket-name'          # CHANGE ME!!
$ cat 3-object-bucket/1-channel.yaml | \
    sed "s/<EXPOSED MINIO URL>/$MINIO_URL/g" | \
    oc apply -f -
```

> Note: 
> 1. The MINIO_URL pattern must be `<HTTP/HTTPS>://<URI>/<BUCKET>`,for example: http://my-minio.example.com/my-bucket;
> 2. As here we're using `sed` to replace the content, we have to escape the special char `\`.

> OUTPUT:

```
channel.app.ibm.com/object-bucket created
```

#### Subscription

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc apply -f 3-object-bucket/2-subscription.yaml
```

> OUTPUT:

```
subscription.app.ibm.com/app-nginx created
application.app.k8s.io/app-nginx created
placementrule.app.ibm.com/app-nginx-prod created
```

#### Outcome

In Hub Cluster:

```sh
$ oc get appsub,application,placementrule -l app=app-nginx -n app-project
NAME                                 STATUS       AGE
subscription.app.ibm.com/app-nginx   Propagated   4m42s

NAME                               AGE
application.app.k8s.io/app-nginx   4m42s

NAME                                       AGE
placementrule.app.ibm.com/app-nginx-prod   4m41s
```

In Managed Cluster:

```sh
$ kubectl get pod -n default
kubectl get deploy,pod -n default
NAME                          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```

### Pattern #4: GitHub Repo

TODO

## Annex

### Setup MinIO

This is a very simple guide about how to setup MinIO server in OpenShift by using Helm Chart to support Pattern #3.

You may refer to the official docs [here](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio) for more details.

```sh
$ MINIO_NANESPACE=app-entitlement           # CHANGE ME!!
$ MINIO_HELM_CHART_NAME=my-minio            # CHANGE ME!!

$ oc create sa $MINIO_HELM_CHART_NAME

# To grant permission for the sa MinIO uses
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:$MINIO_NANESPACE:my-minio
# This might be optional if my PR (https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/21907) is accepted
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:$MINIO_NANESPACE:default

$ helm install --name $MINIO_HELM_CHART_NAME stable/minio --tls \
    --set persistence.enabled=false \
    --set serviceAccount.create=false \
    --set serviceAccount.name=$MINIO_HELM_CHART_NAME \
    --set "buckets[0].name=my-bucket" \
    --set "buckets[0].policy=none"

$ oc expose service/my-minio
$ oc get routes
NAME       HOST/PORT                                                                                                      PATH   SERVICES   PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
my-minio   <EXPOSED MINIO URL>          my-minio   http                 None
```

> Notes:

1. Take note of the `accessKey` and `secretKey` generated. If you didn't set that, there has already one pair by default -- assuming we're going to use the default key pair for simplicity:

```
accessKey: "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
secretKey: "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
```

2. Take note of the `<EXPOSED MINIO URL>` for further configuration in `Channel`.


Lastly, we need to copy over the manifest files into the `my-bucket`.

You may do it through UI, or CLI as blow:

```sh
$ mc config host add my-minio http://<EXPOSED MINIO URL> AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

$ mc cp 3-object-bucket/objects-in-bucket/deploy.yaml my-minio/my-bucket
$ mc cp 3-object-bucket/objects-in-bucket/service.yaml my-minio/my-bucket

$ mc ls my-minio/my-bucket
[2020-04-16 11:35:01 +08]    339B deploy.yaml
[2020-04-16 11:35:46 +08]    169B service.yaml
```
